<h2> &nbsp About me</h2>
<div class="generalpink">
I have always had a drive to be a teacher. As a middle and high school Mathematics teacher, I know that my students start at different places, need various supports, or even desire a different outcome. 
<br>
<br>My job has always been to check the pulse of my classroom to make sure that all students are getting what they need. My yoga class is meant to do the same. I wants to help students from where they are, and give them what they need every time they enter the room. 
I hope for my classes to be inspiring, and motivating in a way that will challenge students physically, but also become place for a release of stress and anxiety. 
<br>
<br> As a marathoner runner, I understand that there are many times where we put our body through stress and, even pain. Practicing yoga is our way to say thank you to ourselves and show our bodies the love that it deserves and needs.</p>
