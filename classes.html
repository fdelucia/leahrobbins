        <h2> Vinyasa Flow</h2>
        <img src="Images/downdog.png">
        <p> In my typical vinyasa class you can expect to feel grounded with your breath and uplifted through the various poses. Class will always offer many modifications, with your needs being my number one priority. I look forward to flowing with you and seeing you on the mat!</p>

        <h2>Kids Yoga</h2>
        <img src="Images/tree.png">
        <p>As a middle school math teacher, my passion has always been in helping children. Being a witness to children and their reaction to stress, anxiety, and even addiction to electronics, I believe that yoga can help sooth a child's mind while helping them to cope with their environment. I see no greater joy than helping children reach their full potential.</p>

        <h2>Yoga for Runners</h2>
        <img src="Images/tree.png">
        <p> Through a partnership with the Runners Clinic, I teach a yoga for Runners Class at their office each Wednesday. While this class is geared towards runners, all are welcome!  I will focus on areas runners find most problematic: hamstrings, calves, hips as well as my favorite, abs!</p>

        <h2>Private</h2>
        <img src="Images/seatedtwist.png">
        <p>Private classes are a great way to focus on specific poses or to learn to personalize your practice due to an injury. I teach one on one classes as well as private lessons for groups. Please send me a message if you are interested in learning more about private sessions. </p>
